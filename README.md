# Spotidal - your lifesaver when moving!

Transfer your Spotify favorites library to Tidal!  
For now, the queries aren't working really well. So you may encounter a lot of prompts to provide an alternative. But this is better, than just trying to guess. As it shows, many songs are just absent in Tidal, compared to Spotify, so this would be a mess.

TODOs:

- Provide better styled prompts and CLI experience
- Make queries better (somehow...)
- Change the way API wrappers work so the songs are added faster. (It took me _~5mins_ to transfer 341 song-containing library)
- Implement local "caching system", so that you can continue where you left off after a filure or simply a break
